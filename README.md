Elden Ring Build Generator

With many different possible armour sets, stat allocations, and weapons, I found that creating a character in From Software's Elden Ring is a daunting task. 
The game provides little to no advice on where to continue from your starting class, and unfortunately this means that players often make inefficient combinations. 
This can turn an otherwise fun game into a frustrating and unfair experience.   

The Elden Ring Build Generator is meant to help beginner and intermediate Elden Ring players with selecting a suitable and scalable build for the game while keeping their preferences in mind. 

For me, I am using this project as an opportunity to initially learn the Spring Boot framework to implement the backend.
My application follows a layered architecture consisting of model, repository, service, and controller packages. 
The model layer defines the core data structures, the repository layer manages the database interactions, the service layer implements the business logic, and the controller layer exposes RESTful endpoints to external clients. 
This organization ensures that the codebase is clean, maintainable, and scalable as the project grows.

To run the backend, simply clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, and use the mvn spring-boot:run command. Once running, the server will be available at http://localhost:8080/.
